# X-LAB Plotting – Generic Example Implementation

Welcome to the **Generic Example Implementation** for **X-LAB Plotting**.

This repository provides a minimal, fully functional reference implementation
that shows how to structure data types, processors, plotters, and workers so
they can be discovered and used by the main X-LAB Plotting Manager GUI.

- If you want a quick overview of what’s here, see  
  [What this example provides](what-this-example-provides.md).
- If you want to understand how the pieces fit together, see  
  [Concepts & architecture](concepts-and-architecture.md).
- If you want to plug this into the GUI or build your own modules, see  
  [Using & extending](using-and-extending.md).

This repository only contains the *example* implementation modules. It is
intended to be read, modified, copied, or replaced when creating your own
plotting modules.
